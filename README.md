# Multithreaded-Synchronization

This is my Operating Systems cource's assigment to solve synchronization Taxi problem.
Prevent wait for a long time to reach.
Simulated and solved with mutex and semaphores.
I used POSIX library(pthread).
Compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Considered the status of starvation.
